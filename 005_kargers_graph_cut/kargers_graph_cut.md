# Karger's Minimum Cut Algorithm

This implements Karger's algorithm to find the minimum cut in a graph. Karger's algorithm is a randomized algorithm to compute a minimum cut of a connected, undirected graph.

`kargers_algorithm` function runs multiple trials of Karger's algorithm to find the most frequently occurring minimum cut.
